# Things to look at

1. Sales Model, Product Model
2. SalesController, Api/SalesController
3. Web Routes, Api Routes
4. CalculateSellingPriceRequest & StoreSaleRequest
5. Factories, Migrations, Seeders
6. app.js, coffee-sales.js
7. coffee_sales.blade.php
8. SaleTest

# Notes

1. I used seeded user so please do the same (email: "sales@coffee.shop" password: "password")
2. Please run the migrations & seeder (php artisan migrate --seed)
3. I've seeded Gold Coffee and Arabic Coffee. With more time I would create the UI to add and manage Products.
4. Shipping cost I have assumed to be related to Product, otherwise I would add it in a ShippingMethod Model.

Thank you for the oppertunity & I hope you like it.
